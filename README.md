## 🎯 What We're Building

Protocols have yields. Institutions have capital. But auditors reject protocol-provided valuations. We're the **compliance infrastructure layer** that bridges the gap.

### The Problem ($20B Market, One Critical Blocker)

Tokenized credit hit $20B TVL, but institutional allocators can't deploy capital. The problem isn't yields, regulation, or technology risk—it's **audit compliance**.

- ❌ **Protocol-Provided NAVs**: Auditors reject them (conflict of interest)
- ❌ **Internal Models**: Cost $200-400K annually, still need external validation
- ❌ **Traditional Bureaus**: Zero tokenized coverage, 60-90 day lags

### Our Solution

**Decentralized Credit Oracle**: AI + Human Validators + Byzantine Consensus = Real-time marks that pass Basel III/Solvency II audit

- 🤖 **Specialized AI Agents**: 91-93% accuracy per credit type
- 👥 **Professional Validators**: 98%+ final accuracy with human oversight
- ⚡ **Byzantine Consensus**: 4-15 minute query-to-result time
- ✅ **Basel III Compliant**: Daily fair value marks, audit-ready
